# Positive Affirmations

## Goals

- Make passive income.
- Make an app that will look good on my portfolio.
- Learn to make a full-stack production-ready application using new technology. Use more current frameworks.
- Have an app that helps the user identify and reinforce good traits about themselves by:
  - Sending them subliminal messages
  - Reinforcing affifrmations about them by giving them feedback from other real people
  - Acting as a sort of cheerleader for the user

## Use cases

- Get personal details
- View list of affirmations (by everyone on the platform)
- Send a reaffirmation to a public user's posting
- Create a new affirmation
- Update your affirmation
- Deactivate your affirmation
- Like a public affirmation

### Reaffirmations

The idea is that you can send users a sort of letter that will be posted into a user's personal Letter feed. Reaffirmations are constructed based on pre-defined values:

- Note
- Font (for the note)
- Stamp
